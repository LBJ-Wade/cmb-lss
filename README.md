Auto-correlations, cross-correlations and cosmological MCMC fits from Large Scale Structure (LSS), CMB lensing and CMB temperature data.

**Instructions:**
1. Define experiment configuration in configs.yml
2. Investigate data and correlations in Jupyter Notebooks
3. Run MCMC ```python run_emcee.py -c <name of the configuration> -t <tag added as suffix to the experiment name>```

**Libraries used:**
- Core Cosmological Library (CCL) (https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL) (https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCLX)
- NaMaster (https://namaster.readthedocs.io/en/latest)
